# Awesome Automated Alignment

This is a collection of papers and other resources for scalable automated alignment. which corresponds to the **survey paper "Towards Scalable Automated Alignment: A Survey"**. We will update the survey content and this paper list regularly, and we very much welcome suggestions of any kind.


Welcome to follow and star! 



*We will release the full version of this repo within this week.*

## Abstract

Alignment is the most critical step in building large language models (LLMs) that meet human needs. 
With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. 
Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. 
Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.
